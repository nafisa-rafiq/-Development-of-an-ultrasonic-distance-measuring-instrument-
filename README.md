# Development of an ultrasonic distance-measuring instrument using Arduino UNO

In this project, I created a distance measuring device using an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino UNO. I interfaced the ultrasonic sensor and an LCD display to the Arduino, where the display was used to show the measured distance. Using a custom code that was uploaded to the Arduino, the device was able to measure distances in real-time.
